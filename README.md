# Design-and-Noise-analysis-of-CMOS-ineverter
Design and Noise analysis of CMOS ineverter

This project has motive of experimenting with working of an inverter and understanding the parameters involved with it. The design will utilise the models that are present under the skywater 130nm pdk and various open source tools such as, Xschem, NGSPICE, etc.

The whole process starts with analysis of NMOS and PMOS devices, specifically the 1.8v standard models available inside the pdk to determine a common working W/L ratio and also the gm, ron and similar values. After this we start with the design of a CMOS inverter that includes schematic, measurement noise margin parameters.
